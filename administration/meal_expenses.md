# Meal Expenses

If you're arranging meals for a meeting:

1. **Coordinate via GrubHub**  
   - Share your preferred restaurant, desired ordering time, and expected delivery time.  
   - The budget limitation will be **$23–$25 per person**, considering tax, service fees, and delivery charges.

2. **Share the Order Link**  
   - Once Kim provides the **GrubHub** link, post it in the **#general** channel and request others to add their orders by the ordering time.

3. **Confirm the Order**  
   - When it’s time to place the order, send a confirmation email to **Kim**.

4. **Pick up food**
